## Task

write a method, which:

takes an array of intervals in format: [[1,4], [7, 10], [3, 5]]

- amount of intervals can be any, the interval always contains two numbers, the first number is always less than the second
- intersecting intervals must be counted only once
- returns the sum of all interval lengths

## Example

Sum of the above intervals is 7 

Because the intervals [1,4] and [3,5] intersect and can be considered as an interval [1,5] which is 4, and an interval [7,10] which is 3.
